# grafton-birddog

Unofficial idiomatic rust bindings for the [BirdDog RESTful API 2.0](https://birddog.tv/AV/API/index.html)

## Usage

See the [examples](examples) directory for usage examples.

## Status

This is a work in progress that we use on our own projects, so we're really only testing each API function as we need them. If you find a bug, please open an issue or submit a PR. Thanks!

## Roadmap

- [x] BirdDog PLAY API functions
- [ ] PTZ Camera API functions (We don't have one to test with)

## Installation

Add the following to `Cargo.toml` under `[dependencies]`:

```
